These may follow any of three paths: (a) The excitation energy is lost without dissociation into radicals (by collision, or possibly radiation, as in aromatic hydrocarbons). (b) The molecules dissociate, but the resulting radicals recombine without escaping from the liquid cage. (c) The molecules dissociate and escape from the cage. In this case we would not expect them to move more than a few molecular diameters through the dense medium before being thermalized. In accordance with the notation introduced by Burton, Magee, and Samuel,22 the molecules following 22 Burton, Magee, and Samuel, J. Chern. Phys. 20, 760 (1952). THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS paths (a) and (b) can be designated H 2 0* and those following path (c) can be designated H 2 0t. It seems reasonable to assume for the purpose of these calculations that the ionized H 2 0 molecules will become the H 20 t molecules, but this is not likely to be a complete correspondence. In conclusion we would like to emphasize that the qualitative result of this section is not critically dependent on the exact values of the physical parameters used. However, this treatment is classical, and a correct treatment must be wave mechanical; therefore the result of this section cannot be taken as an a priori theoretical prediction. The success of the radical diffusion model given above lends some plausibility to the occurrence of electron capture as described by this crude calculation. Further work is clearly needed. A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigatiflg such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting individual molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results for the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient expansion.},

@article{Kubo1957,
abstract = {A general type of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is discussed to show that the physical quantities such as complex susceptibility of magnetic or electric polarization and complex conductivity for electric conduction are rigorously expressed in terms of time-fluctuation of dynamical variables associated with such irreversible processes. This is a generalization of statistical mechanics which affords exact formulation as the basis of calculation of such irreversible quantities from atomistic theory. The general formalism of this statistical-mechanical theory is examined in detail. The response, relaxation, and correlation functions are defined in quantummechanical way and their relations are investigated. The formalism is illustrated by simple examples of magnetic and conduction problems. Certain sum rules are discussed for these examples. Finally it is pointed out that this theory may be looked as a generalization of the Einstein relation. {\textcopyright} 1957, THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN. All rights reserved.},

@book{Peebles1980,
abstract = {Opinions on the large-scale structure of the early universe range widely from primeval chaos to a well-ordered mass distribution. P.J.E. Peebles argues that the evolution proceeded from a nearly uniform initial state to a progressively more irregular and clumpy universe. The discussion centers on the largest known structures, the clusters of galaxies, the empirical evidence of the nature of the clustering, and the theories of how the clustering evolves in an expanding universe. In Chapter One the author provides an historical introduction to the subject. Chapter Two contains a survey of methods used to deal with the Newtonian approximation to the theory of the evolution of the mass distribution. Recent progress in the use of statistical measures of the clustering is described in Chapter Three. Chapters Four and Five return to techniques for dealing with cosmic evolution, in the statistical measures of clustering and under general relativity theory. Lastly, in Chapter Six Professor Peebles assesses the progress in attempts to link theory and observation to arrive at a well established physical picture of the nature and evolution of the universe.
